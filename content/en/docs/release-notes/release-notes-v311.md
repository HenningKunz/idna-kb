panagenda is proud to announce this new release of iDNA Applications.
Whether you’re in a Notes/Domino modernization or migration project,
iDNA gives you the knowledge to deliver the most difficult projects
efficiently, on time and on budget. 

This new version is a small but important bug-fix release for the
critical milestone release 3.0.0. It requires panangeda's new base
operating system Alma Linux.

  

{{% callout type="warning" %}}

Our previous operating system CentOS Linux 7 has reached end of life
(EOL) on June 30, 2024. Please see the [official announcement by Red
Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/centos-linux-eol) for more
details.

panagenda provides new virtual images based on Alma Linux 9, a RHEL
based open source Linux distribution. We encourage all customers to
migrate their installations to the new virtual image.

{{% callout type="info" %}}

From version 3.0.0 onward, iDNA Applications upgrade packages will not
be backward compatible with the previous CentOS-based appliances. Please
deploy a new v3 Alma Linux appliance to continue benefiting from iDNA's
latest and greatest features!

## **Bug Fixes**

  

**Design Collection:** A bug has been fixed that could lead to
continuously attempted re-collection of previously failed databases.
While this would NOT impact data quality, the continuous re-collection
results in unnecessary CPU and Memory consumption on the virtual
appliance.

  

  

  

## **Structural Changes / Upgrade Path**

  

### **Upgrade Procedure: Container Installer**

Details on how to update to this new version can be found in the
knowledge base article [Upgrading iDNA
